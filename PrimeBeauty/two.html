     Most of us assume skincare is not important, but it is one of the most important things. It is true that we are all bound to have
    skin problems as we age, but you can also cause problems if you do not give your skin the proper care it requires. With skincare, we
    can prolong skin problems, or even stop them from happening. While following a skincare routine, it's crucial to remember results
    are not instantaneous, they take time. Not only that, but not all products work for everyone as we all have different skin types.
    It could take weeks or months before you find the right moisturizer or cleanser.  It can be frustrating, but you have to remember,
    that once you find the product that works for you, it is worth the patience. Skincare can even help you feel more confident as you start
    to notice your skin is glowing or starting to become clear. The best part is skincare requires very little time. Now, I do not want
    people to go and try everything, that can be very damaging to your skin barrier. I will recommend products, so you do not have to go
    searching, but doing your own research is still helpful. Many of us also do not know what to apply to our skin or when to apply it, so
    so I am going post a
    <a

      <b>chart</b></a>
    that tells you what to apply and when. Now you do not have to apply all of the things, the chart is more of a guideline to help you
    get started.
