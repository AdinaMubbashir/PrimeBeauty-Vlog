   <h1 class="top">BEST OF BEAUTY</h1>
   <p>
     I want people to understand the importance of makeup. Everyone is beautiful with makeup and without it. Makeup is a tool
     that is powerful and it has become the most used tool by women. Many believe makeup is just worn to hide insecurities,
     but it is more than that. Makeup is art. We are able to create a variety of looks with a simple brush. People are
     paid to do makeup because it is hard and requires time and practice. Essentially, it is a skill. People blend different
     shades of colours and create a sculpted face. It is life-changing. You can just roll off your bed and choose which version
     of yourself you want the world to see today. Maybe you want more defined cheekbones, a poutier lip, or slightly arched
     eyebrows. The point is, makeup is a creative outlet that helps us feel more confident about ourselves. There might be somethings
     you do not like about your face and chose to cover them as you do not want people to focus on the pimple in between your eyebrows.
     Makeup allows you to fake it until you achieve your skin goals. While we all have flaws, and we do not have to hide them, sometimes
     we want the world to notice more than our imperfections. Many might not know this, but makeup can also contain ingredients that
     protect your skin, so why not wear some. Most importatnly, makeup is theraputic as it allows people to release their pent up emotions and
     experince peace in thier minds. Makeup is bliss.<br><br>

     The makeup industry has not always been inclusive in terms of their shade ranges in foundations, concealers, and blushes. It is slowly
     getiting there. The products I am going to recommend come in various shades so nobody feels left out. Do not be afraid to give them
     a shot.<br><br>
