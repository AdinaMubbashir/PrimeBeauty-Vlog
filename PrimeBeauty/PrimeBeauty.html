     coming out every day. Whether you are a person with dry skin, oily, or in between, on here, you can find products recommended by
     me for all skin types. Prime Beauty is a beauty blog dedicated to helping people find what works for them so they feel more confident

     somewhere out there existed the perfect products for my skin. Let me take you all on this journey.<br><br>

   <h1 class="second">WHY MAKEUP</h1>
   <p>
    You might be wondering, why makeup? It is important to note that makeup does that change how you look, it enhances your
    features. One of the many reasons I choose to write about makeup was that it made be feel confident. A little mit mascara,
    blush, and a bold lip can go a long way and make someone feel powerful and boost their self confidence. Some of us wear makeup to
    cover our blemishes, darkspots, and pimples. While these things are natural, they can make us feel insecure. Finding the right
    kind of foundation and concealer can make all the difference. Others wear makeup to express who they are and bring colour
    into this world with their bright looks. Whether you believe in makeup or not, give it a chance and see what a difference it
    make for you. <br><br>

   <h1 class="third">WHY SKINCARE</h1>
   <p>
    Taking care of your skin should be part of your healthy lifetyle as it is the largest organ in our bodies. Having a good skincare
    routine prevents problems from developing and keeps your skin looking fresh and youthful. All of us have different skin types and it is
    important to know what your skin type is in order to understand what you need to keep your skin healthy. In addition, bad skin choices
    can have lifelong effects. Start today and establish a good skincare routine.<br>
